## Common Questions

**Does tidied upload my photos?**
No — everything runs on-device. We don't have servers, accounts, analytics, or tracking.

**Is this app going to delete all my photos?**
No. Nothing is deleted automatically. You choose what to delete, and we always show a confirmation before any bulk delete.

**How do deletions work?**
tidied uses Apple's Photos framework. Deletions work like the Photos app: you select items and iOS asks for confirmation. In most cases, deleted items go to **Recently Deleted**, where you can restore them for a limited time (often ~30 days) unless you permanently remove them.

**What if I delete something by mistake?**
Open the Photos app → Albums → **Recently Deleted** → select the item → Recover.

**Why does tidied need Photos access?**
Only to display your library so you can review items. Photos never leave your device.

**Can I limit access to only some photos?**
Yes — you can choose **Selected Photos** in iOS, and change this anytime in Settings → tidied → Photos. If you run out of selected photos, the app will prompt you to select more or grant full access.
